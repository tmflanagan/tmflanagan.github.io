      <a href="https://microshare.io">Microshare</a>
      <span> required me to develop some tools for internal use which might prove useful for others facing similar problems, so Iâ€™ve written the following document to explain their application and how they can most easily be modified for later use. The first of these is a tool that takes server config files and parses data out of them to plot a graph respresenting the overall datastream, the second is a script for identifying statistically significant changes in the latency of a web application. As-is, both contain some elements specific to the work I was doing at Microshare, so the aim of this document is to provide a short, straightforward explanation of how to reconfigure these tools for similar use cases.</span>
